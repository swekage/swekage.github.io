title: A detailed day in the life of a good Sofware Engineer at Meta making $368K w/ 6 yrs of exp

Welcome! As someone who has worked at Meta, I see and get a lot of questions about what it's actually like to work in one of these companies. I 100% understand since for a long time, I also wondered the same thing. Now that I have worked there, I'm able to share what a day in my life was like. If working at FAANG is one of your dreams, I hope you find this inspiring or helpful.

During my time at Meta, I was "required" to go to the office 2 times a week and allowed to work remotely the other days. To this day, I'm a huge fan of remote work because of all the time it gives back to my life. All the time I spent commuting, I can now spend on laundry, hanging out with my wife, or if I really want, working more, so I believe it benefits my employer as well! I'll share what my day was like for both when I was working remotely as well as in the office.

What do I mean by "good" software engineer. show ee rating. I've been at Meta for a year as an E4.

Say how a lot of the day in the life videos focus a lot on the perks but don't share much about the actual engineering work. Personally, I would have really wanted to see how other engineers work to see how I was doing compared to them.

## WFH

### 9:45 AM: Wake up

Wake up to the pleasant chirping of my iPhone's alarm sound. I use Radar like everyone else. Roll over and hit snooze. Fall back asleep...

### 9:55 AM: Wake up again

Get woken up again by Radar. Roll over and hit snooze again instead of cancel in case I accidentally fall asleep again. I have standup at 10 so I really can't fall asleep again this time. I'm not trying to show up on camera in standup in my tank top so I roll out of bed with my eyes still half stuck together, and replace my tank top for a t-shirt from my closet. I don't brush my teeth in the morning because I don't get morning breath and why would I? It's not like I'm eating anything while I'm sleeping so what is there to brush? Also, multiple dentists have also told me I have no cavities. It's okay to be jealous.

add images of my setup? my full size bed?

### 10:05 AM: Standup

Meta does this thing of starting meetings 5 minutes past the hour rather than on the dot. So a 10AM meeting actually starts at 10:05AM. It's supposed to make hybrid work easier because it gives the people in the office some time to find a conference room to do the meeting in. It reminds me of a practice called Michigan Time, at the University of Michigan where classes would officially start ten minutes after the hour to give students enough time to travel from class to class since often they would be located in different buildings on the enormous campus.

But anyway, back to the point.

The purpose of standup, which happens 3 times a week, is to allow members of the team to provide updates and raise concerns. It's very common in software that as you make progress on a project and learn more, you discover incoming issues that can extend the project timeline, or possibly derail the project altogether. I'll provide an update by saying that the current estimates still look good and we're on track. At the end, the product manager or engineering manager will open the floor and ask if there is anything else to bring up. This allows us to point out issues that may not be directly project related, like an engineer noticing slower performance recently, and wanting to get some opinions on next steps. Usually though, standups don't take more than 15 minutes.

I've been in standups before where the expectation is that you will answer 3 questions: "what did you do yesterday?", "what will you do today?", and "are you blocked"? These tend to encourage long responses from people that feel pressured to show they are being very productive, and the worst part is, it seems to actually garner approval and be well received. My opinion is that this just wastes people's time, both the person providing the update, and the people listening to it, especially because over a week, you start the hear a lot of the same things as usually tasks will take multiple days, so a person's standup update will be exactly the same for a week straight.

### 10:20 AM: Catch up on email and messages

After standup, I'll have about half an hour where I can look at email, chat messages, and also check feedback on my pull requests. Usually, the messages I receive will be other developers asking for code review, a product manager asking for feedback on a product requirements document, or a designer seeing if I can take a look at their mockups and provide feedback.

### 11:05 AM: 1 on 1 with new engineer

Our team has a new engineer who set up a weekly 1 on 1 with me.

### 11:35 AM: 1 on 1 with engineering manager

### 12:05 AM:

### 1:30 PM: Lunch

### 2:30 PM:

### 4:00 PM:

end state is to have a breakdown of what I'm doing in my day. WFH and also not working from home.

I've never really cared about the prestige of it, although I will admit now that I have worked there, it did feel good to be able to tell people that you work at a FAANG. When people asked "so where do you work?", I would always find myself pausing a slight second as if what I'm about to say could be socially taboo before saying "I work at Meta", and I'll always feel like the air shifts a little, like the person I'm talking to is suddenly recalibrating the way they should talk to me because of this new information.

What I did care about were how much more interesting the work was supposed to be, and of course, the money. I think there was a long period of time up to about 2018 that most software engineers didn't really know just how much money could be made inside a FAANG company, because most people were still using Glassdoor, which would say that the average Software Engineer at Google was making like $170k. And don't get me wrong, for someone coming straight out of a coding bootcamp after dropping out of college, $170k sounded like infinite money. But after more FAANG software engineers started to post their real compensations online on sites like teamblind.com and levels.fyi, the world was shocked to see kids graduating college and immediately making as much money as doctors who had needed a decade more schooling. Some were so shocked that they refused to believe it was possible.
